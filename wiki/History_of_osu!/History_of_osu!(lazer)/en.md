# History of osu!(lazer)

The [osu!(lazer)](wiki/Client/Release_stream/Lazer) client first started as a major visual refresh for the stable client's interface codenamed ["osu!next"](https://osunext.tumblr.com) made by [flyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3103765), osu!'s lead designer. 
The work on the concept started in 2014, with a [teaser video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrWyqpNUwBo) showcased in the following year.
Due to

# osu!next concept (2014-2015)

The visual refresh idea started after flyte met peppy, seeing him work on stuff and critisizing the design. Therefore peppy told flyte to work on the design instead.
